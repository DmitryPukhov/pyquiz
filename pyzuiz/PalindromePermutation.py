    Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
    drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
    is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
    EXAMPLE
    Input: Tact Coa
    Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
    Hints: #106, #121, #134, #136
