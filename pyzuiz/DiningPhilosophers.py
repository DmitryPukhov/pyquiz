    Dining Philosophers: In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are
    sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs
    both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock
    could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using
    threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadÂ­
    locks.
